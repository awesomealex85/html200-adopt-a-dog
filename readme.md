Testing:
Step 1: Validate code: run code through HTML validator and CSS validator. Ran code through HTML and CSS validators for each page and styles sheet to ensure no errors in the code where present.

Step 2: Functional test: Opened the site to ensure everything looks in order and in place. then proceeded to check all links to make sure they are working correctly. Blog links were linked to the same blog corrected to link to the correct blogs. Made sure features such as hover effects and onclick events are working correctly. Visited the site using Chrome, FireFox, and Edge. The website performed correctly and looked the same across all browsers.

Step 3: Responsiveness:
Checked Responsiveness using the developer tools inside of chrome to see how the website would look like at different screen sizes. Made sure that the dog tiles fit into narrow screen sizes to not require side scrolling. Testing in table sizes to ensure 2 dogs tiles fitted on screen and then tested phone size screen to have one dog tile take up entire screen width. The website performed is functions across all sizes and adapted to various device sizes easily. Finally Checked on MacOS with Safari, Chrome and Firefox, the website preformed all its functions and appeared the same as when on the Windows Browsers.
